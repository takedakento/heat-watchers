    <h1>The Impact of Climate Change on Urban Heat Islands (UHI) in Canada</h1>
    <p>
        Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of our time, with rising global temperatures leading to more frequent and intense heatwaves.
        In urban environments, this warming effect is further amplified by the UHI, where cities experience significantly higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas.
        This occurs due to factors such as high concentrations of heat-absorbing surfaces, reduced vegetation, and human activities that generate heat.
    </p>
    <p>
        As Canada experiences increasing temperature extremes, understanding the relationship between climate change and urban heat islands is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate their impact.
        Cities like Toronto are particularly vulnerable, with densely built environments exacerbating heat retention, leading to health risks, energy demand spikes, and reduced overall livability.
    </p>

<!-- MAP SECTION (Row 1) -->

    <h1>Toronto Heat Vulnerability Map</h1>

    <button id="resetZoom">Reset Zoom</button>
    <select id="data-toggle">
        <option value="vulnerability">Heat Vulnerability</option>
        <option value="exposure">Heat Exposure</option>

    </select>

    <div id="map-container">

    </div>

    <!-- INTERPRETATION OF THE MAP -->
    <p>
        This map visually represents areas in the city that are most susceptible to extreme heat. The map uses a color gradient, with lighter shades indicating lower vulnerability
        and darker shades representing higher vulnerability. The vulnerability index is calculated based on factors such as surface temperature, green space availability, and population density.
    </p>
    <p>
        From the visualization, it is evident that highly urbanized areas with dense infrastructure and limited vegetation tend to have greater heat vulnerability, particularly in the downtown core.
        In contrast, regions with more greenery, such as parks and suburban neighborhoods, show lower vulnerability levels. Certain industrial zones, especially in Etobicoke and Scarborough,
        show moderate to high vulnerability. This helps us pinpoint neighborhoods that need targeted heat mitigation strategies, such as increased tree planting and better access to cooling centers.

    <h2>Yearly Temperature Trends in Toronto</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <svg id="lineChart" width="800" height="400"></svg>
    </div>

    <!-- LINE CHART DESCRIPTION -->
    <p>
        This graph is a crucial piece of evidence for analyzing how climate change contributes to the intensification of Urban Heat Islands (UHI) in Toronto.
        The data shows periodic temperature variations, with some years experiencing sharp declines followed by noticeable rises.
        Despite short-term fluctuations, there is a gradual upward trend, indicative of climate change effects.
        This visualization serves as supporting evidence for the increasing urban heat effect in Toronto, demonstrating how rising temperatures contribute to intensifying urban heat islands.

    <h2>Shifts in Seasonal Precipitation Patterns</h2>
    <div id="chart-container"></div>

    <!-- BAR CHART DESCRIPTION -->
    <p>
        This chart highlights changes in Toronto’s rainfall patterns over two time periods: 1991–2005 and 2006–2021.
        The observed differences in precipitation levels are closely linked to the impacts of climate change, which directly influences urban heat islands (UHIs) and extreme weather events in the city.
    </p>
    <p>
        While some months show increased precipitation in the recent period (2006–2021), others show a decline compared to the earlier period (1991–2005).
        Variability in rainfall can influence surface temperatures, as drier conditions reduce evaporative cooling, exacerbating heat retention in urban areas.
    </p>
    <p>
        Less precipitation in warmer months (June–September) means less cooling from rainfall, increasing heat vulnerability, especially in high-density urban zones.
        Periods of reduced rainfall may also lead to drought conditions, which weaken the cooling effects of vegetation and increase heat stress in the city.
